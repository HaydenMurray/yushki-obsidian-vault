# Progression Pacing Document

## Two Concepts: Spire of Echoes & GRINDSTONE

Both games share a core loop: **idle income → sacrifice generators as combat units → lose income to survive → rebuild**. The tension between growing rich and spending your earners is the entire emotional engine.

---

# THEME A: SPIRE OF ECHOES

> Cozy lighthouse. Magical creature companions (Echoes). Storms (Gales) as bosses. 4×4 grid.

## First 2 Hours — Minute by Minute

### Minutes 0–1: The Arrival

**What the player DOES:**
- Watches a brief scene: a crumbling lighthouse on a cliff. Rain. A single glowing creature — a tiny moth-like Echo — drifts toward the player. It lands on the lighthouse lens.
- The lens flickers to life. The moth generates 1 Lumen/sec.
- Player taps/clicks the moth. It purrs. A name appears: something procedural and soft, like "Pipkin" or "Dewdrop."

**What UNLOCKS:** The lighthouse interior. A single perch where the Echo sits. The Lumen counter.

**What the player FEELS:** Curiosity. Warmth. "Oh, it's cute." The cozy aesthetic does immediate work — this isn't a game that's going to hurt me. (It will.)

---

### Minutes 1–3: First Economy

**What the player DOES:**
- Lumens tick up. At 10 Lumens, a prompt: "A new Echo is drawn to the light." Player buys their second Echo (costs 10 Lumens).
- Second Echo is visually distinct — maybe a firefly type. It generates 1.2 Lumens/sec.
- Both Echoes sit on perches. They interact — little idle animations. One nudges the other.

**What UNLOCKS:** The "Summon Echo" button. The concept of different Echo types (cosmetic only at this stage, but seeds variety).

**What the player FEELS:** Satisfaction. Collection instinct activates. "I want more of these."

---

### Minutes 3–5: The Collection Grows

**What the player DOES:**
- Buys Echo #3 (cost 25 Lumens), Echo #4 (cost 50 Lumens). Costs scale.
- The lighthouse interior fills up. Echoes have personality — one sleeps, one bounces around.
- At 4 Echoes, the lighthouse lens burns brighter visually. A small weather vane on the roof starts spinning.

**What UNLOCKS:** The weather vane UI element — it's pointing toward something. A tooltip: "A Gale approaches..."

**What the player FEELS:** Momentum. The economy feels good — numbers go up, cute creatures multiply. But that weather vane introduces a prickle of unease. Foreshadowing.

---

### Minutes 5–10: The First Gale

**What the player DOES:**
- A storm cloud appears on the horizon. A timer: "Gale arrives in 60 seconds."
- The game explains: "Echoes can protect the lighthouse. Place them on the barrier." A 4×4 grid appears around the lighthouse — the sea wall.
- Player drags Echoes onto grid tiles. Each Echo placed STOPS generating Lumens. The income counter visibly drops.
- The Gale arrives: a swirling dark cloud with HP. Echoes on the grid emit light beams that chip away at it. The Gale pushes back — it has a simple attack pattern, hitting the front row.
- With 4 basic Echoes, the player wins comfortably. Echoes return to their perches. A reward: bonus Lumens + a new Echo type unlocked.

**What UNLOCKS:** The combat grid. The core tension mechanic (income vs. defense). A new Echo type: "Shimmer" — generates more Lumens but has low HP.

**What the player FEELS:**
- During placement: "Wait, I lose income?" First brush with the sacrifice mechanic, but it's painless — the Gale is easy, Echoes survive, income resumes.
- After winning: Relief. Pride. "That was cool." The reward feels generous.

**HONEST ASSESSMENT:** This Gale is a tutorial. It CANNOT be threatening or the player will resent the mechanic before understanding it. The danger: it's also not very exciting. **Fix:** Make the storm visually dramatic even if mechanically simple. Sound design carries this — howling wind, the lighthouse groaning, then silence when you win. The spectacle sells the moment.

---

### Minutes 10–15: Rebuilding & Growing

**What the player DOES:**
- Buys the new Shimmer Echo. It's visually pretty and generates 2 Lumens/sec. Player feels smart.
- Buys more basic Echoes. Income is now ~8-10 Lumens/sec.
- Explores the lighthouse: there's a second floor that's locked. "Requires 500 Lumens to restore."
- The weather vane spins again. Next Gale in 3 minutes.

**What UNLOCKS:** Shimmer Echo type. The lighthouse upgrade path (floors = permanent progression).

**What the player FEELS:** Anticipation. "I know what's coming and I'm ready." The locked floor creates a medium-term goal.

---

### Minutes 15–20: The Second Gale & First Real Choice

**What the player DOES:**
- Gale #2 arrives. It's stronger — HP is 3x the first. It also has a mechanic: lightning strikes random tiles, dealing damage to Echoes there.
- Player places Echoes. With ~6-7 Echoes, they need to decide: place the high-income Shimmer (good damage but fragile) or keep it earning?
- If they place Shimmer, it might die to lightning. If they don't, the Gale takes longer and other Echoes take more hits.
- **Most likely outcome:** Player places everything, wins, maybe loses 1 basic Echo to lightning. The Shimmer survives if lucky.

**What UNLOCKS:** Echo permadeath is demonstrated (even if only a basic one dies). Positioning matters — back row is safer.

**What the player FEELS:**
- If the Shimmer dies: "Oh NO." First real sting. It was pretty. It earned well. It's gone.
- If the Shimmer survives: Relief, but the THREAT was felt. "Next time it might not make it."
- **This is the moment the game's thesis lands.** The player understands: these creatures are currency AND soldiers AND companions, and they can be lost.

---

### Minutes 20–30: The Attachment Deepens

**What the player DOES:**
- Income rebuilds. Player buys replacements — but the new Echoes feel like strangers compared to the ones they've had for 15 minutes.
- Unlocks the "Bond" mechanic: Echoes that survive combat gain a tiny star. Bonded Echoes generate 10% more Lumens and have a subtle glow.
- Player starts mentally categorizing: "veterans" vs. "new recruits."
- Saves up for the second lighthouse floor. This feels like a grind — income is ~12-15/sec, need 500.
- Gale #3 approaches. Timer: 2 minutes.

**What UNLOCKS:** Bond mechanic (stars). This is the emotional hook — it makes veterans feel irreplaceable.

**What the player FEELS:** Growing attachment to specific Echoes. The ones with stars are special. The economy grind toward Floor 2 is slightly tedious. **Fix:** Add a mini-discovery at 400 Lumens — a hidden Echo trapped in debris on the coast. Rescue it (free!) and it's a rare type. Breaks the grind with narrative.

**⚠️ HONESTY CHECK — Minute 25 risk zone:** Between Gale #2 and Gale #3, there's a period where the player is just... waiting for numbers. If idle income is too slow, this is where they put the phone down. If it's too fast, the Gale has no economic sting. **Target: Floor 2 should be affordable ~5 minutes after Gale #2, NOT immediately.** 3 minutes of idle, then the rescue event, then Floor 2 purchase, then Gale #3. Keep the cadence tight.

---

### Minutes 30–45: The Gut Punch

**What the player DOES:**
- Gale #3 is a named storm: "The Hollowing." It has a gimmick: after 3 turns, it creates a vortex on one tile that PULLS adjacent Echoes into it, destroying them instantly.
- Player must read the pattern and reposition. This is the first time combat requires active decision-making mid-fight.
- **High likelihood of losing 2-3 Echoes**, including potentially a bonded one.
- After the Gale: the lighthouse is damaged. Floor 2 unlocks a repair bench — player can now craft "Wards" (grid buffs: shields, healing tiles).
- **KEY MOMENT at ~minute 35:** If a bonded Echo dies, the game plays a brief animation — the Echo's light dims, it looks at the player, and dissolves into motes that drift up into the lighthouse lens. The lens glows slightly brighter. *Their light lives on in the tower.*

**What UNLOCKS:** Wards (craftable grid modifiers). Floor 2 of the lighthouse. Active repositioning during combat.

**What the player FEELS:**
- During combat: Panic. Real engagement. "No no no, move!"
- After a bonded Echo dies: **Genuine sadness.** This is the first moment that HURTS. The death animation is designed to be brief but devastating. No melodrama — just a quiet goodbye.
- After unlocking Wards: "Okay, I can prevent that next time." Agency returns.

**This is the first "one more run" inflection point.** The player lost something real and now has a new tool. They want to prove they can do better.

---

### Minutes 45–60: Mastery & The Loop Solidifies

**What the player DOES:**
- Rebuilds. Places Wards on the grid for the first time — a shield Ward on the front row, a healing Ward in the center.
- Gale #4 arrives. Player handles it competently. Loses 0-1 Echoes. Feels like a boss.
- Unlocks Echo Evolution: Echoes with 3+ bond stars can evolve into a stronger form. Their appearance changes, income doubles, combat stats improve. **But evolution resets their bond stars to 0.**
- Player must choose: evolve (power up but lose status) or keep the bonded veteran as-is?
- Income is now ~25-30/sec. Player can afford new things faster. Unlocks the Lantern Room (top of lighthouse) — a prestige/ascension preview.

**What UNLOCKS:** Echo Evolution. Ward crafting is now a regular prep phase. Lantern Room teaser.

**What the player FEELS:** Mastery. Competence. The evolution choice is the first strategic dilemma that isn't forced by combat — it's a proactive decision. Some players will never evolve their favorites. That's valid.

---

### Minutes 60–90: The Rhythm & First Run Failure

**What the player DOES:**
- Loop is now: idle → earn → prep Wards → place Echoes → fight Gale → recover → repeat.
- Gales scale. Gale #5 introduces "Gale Shards" — secondary enemies that target specific columns.
- Player must split forces. The 4×4 grid now requires front-line tanks, back-line damage, and Ward placement synergy.
- **Minute ~75: Gale #6 — "The Drowning."** This is the first Gale designed to be potentially unwinnable on first attempt. It floods the bottom 2 rows, forcing all Echoes to the top 8 tiles. In that compressed space, its AoE attacks devastate.
- **Expected outcome: Player loses.** All deployed Echoes die. The lighthouse dims. The lens flickers.

**What UNLOCKS:** After the loss: the Lantern Room activates. It offers "Echoed Light" — a prestige currency earned from total Lumens generated across all Echoes who ever lived. The player can reset their lighthouse to Floor 1, lose all current Echoes, but gain permanent buffs (Lantern Blessings: +% income, +HP, +grid effects).

**What the player FEELS:**
- During The Drowning: Helplessness. Watching your favorites die in a compressed grid is visceral.
- After the wipe: Grief, but also... clarity. "I wasn't strong enough."
- When the prestige system reveals itself: "OH. So this is the game." The idle-loop-sacrifice-prestige structure clicks. Every Echo that ever lived contributed to the lighthouse's permanent power. Death has meaning.

**⚠️ HONESTY CHECK:** The first forced loss MUST feel fair in retrospect. If the player thinks "that was bullshit," you've failed. **How to ensure fairness:** Give The Drowning a 30-second wind-up where the water visibly rises. Let the player pull Echoes off the grid to save them (saving income generators but weakening defense). The player should feel like they made choices that led here, not that the game cheated.

---

### Minutes 90–120: The Prestige Loop & "One More Run"

**What the player DOES:**
- First prestige. Lighthouse resets. But it's DIFFERENT: the lens is brighter from Echoed Light. The first Echo that arrives is stronger.
- The early game compresses: what took 10 minutes before takes 3. Echoes generate more, costs are the same.
- Player tears through Gales 1-3 quickly. Reaches Gale 4 by minute 100. Gale 5 by minute 110.
- Reaches The Drowning again at ~minute 115. This time, with Lantern Blessings, they can SURVIVE — barely. One Echo left standing.
- Beyond The Drowning: Gale #7 appears. New territory. New storms. The game opens up.

**What UNLOCKS:** Prestige system fully. Post-Drowning content. The realization that there are MANY more Gales.

**What the player FEELS:** Exhilaration. The compressed replay is satisfying — you feel your progress. Beating The Drowning is a genuine triumph. The new content beyond is a reward. **This is the peak "one more run" moment.**

---

## Hours 2–10: Broader Strokes

### Hour 2–5: The Mid-Game Loop

**Loop evolution:**
- Prestiges become routine (~every 30-40 minutes). Each one pushes further into the Gale sequence.
- Echo variety expands: 8-10 types by hour 3, each with distinct grid roles (tank, AoE, healer, buffer).
- **Hour 3 unlock: Echo Bonds.** Two specific Echoes placed adjacent gain a synergy bonus. This adds a puzzle layer to grid placement.
- **Hour 4 unlock: The Chorus.** When 3+ Echoes of the same type are on the grid, they harmonize — a powerful group ability on a cooldown. Encourages specialization.
- **Hour 5 unlock: Gale Seasons.** Gales now come in themed seasons (Frost, Thunder, Fog), each requiring different strategies. Player must maintain multiple Echo "teams."

**What prevents boredom:**
- New Echo types every 2-3 prestiges.
- Named Gales with unique mechanics every 5 Gales.
- Lighthouse floors continue unlocking (workshop, garden, observatory) with new systems.
- The garden lets you plant seeds that grow during idle time → rewards when you return.

**Idle vs. Active:**
- **Idle:** Between Gales, income accumulates. Garden grows. Post-hour-3, idle sessions of 1-4 hours are rewarded with banked Lumens and garden harvests.
- **Active:** Gale combat requires real-time placement and repositioning. Ward prep is active. Evolution choices are active. ~15 min active per 30 min session.

### Hour 5–10: The Late-Early Game

**Loop evolution:**
- Prestiges now push past Gale 15-20. Each Gale after 10 has a unique name and mechanic.
- **Hour 6: The First Leviathan-equivalent — "The Eternal Gale."** A multi-phase boss that spans 3 fights with resource carry-over. You can't idle through it.
- **Hour 7: Echo Memories.** When a bonded Echo dies, it leaves a Memory — a permanent passive buff. Players start strategically sacrificing veterans for their Memories. **This is when sacrifice becomes a CHOICE, not just a consequence.**
- **Hour 8-9: The Lighthouse Network.** Unlock a second lighthouse on a distant island. Manage two economies. Transfer Echoes between them (but travel takes real time). Gales can hit either lighthouse.
- **Hour 10: The Spire.** The lighthouse grows tall enough to pierce the clouds. Above the storms: a new zone. The origin of Echoes. New questions about what they are and why they come to you.

**⚠️ HONESTY CHECK — Hours 6-8 boredom risk:** This is the classic incremental mid-game sag. Prestiges feel routine. New Echoes are variations of old ones. **Fixes:**
1. Echo Memories (hour 7) reframes sacrifice as progression, not loss. Fresh strategic layer.
2. Multi-lighthouse (hour 8) is a structural change that breaks the single-loop monotony.
3. Seasonal Gale events with limited-time Echo types create urgency.
4. Community challenges (if online): collective Gale thresholds for server-wide rewards.

**Valleys to watch:**
- Minute 25: Between Gale 2 and Gale 3. Fix with rescue event.
- Minute 55: After mastering combat but before the wipe. Fix with evolution dilemma.
- Hours 6-8: Mid-game sag. Fix with Memories + multi-lighthouse.

**"One more run" moments:**
1. **Minute 35** (first bonded death): "I need to do better."
2. **Minute 90** (prestige reveal): "I want to see how fast I can get back."
3. **Minute 115** (beating The Drowning): "What's AFTER this?"
4. **Hour 7** (Echo Memories): "If I sacrifice this veteran, I get a permanent buff... one more run to test it."

**Attachment peak:** Minutes 30-45, when Echoes have bond stars and personalities but before the player has learned to see them as expendable. The evolution system (minute 50) begins the transition from "companions" to "resources" — but Memories (hour 7) reframes it as "honored sacrifice."

# THEME B: GRINDSTONE

> Deep-sea mining rig. Drones. Leviathans as bosses. 4×3 grid.

## First 2 Hours — Minute by Minute

### Minutes 0–1: Boot Sequence

**What the player DOES:**
- Black screen. A boot sequence types out: `GRINDSTONE DEEP-SEA EXTRACTION PLATFORM — ONLINE`. Sonar pings. Pressure gauges animate.
- The rig appears: a brutalist metal structure on the ocean floor. Bioluminescent particles drift by.
- A single drone deploys from a bay. It's utilitarian — a box with a drill. It begins mining a nearby ore node. `+1 SHARD/SEC` appears.
- The drone has a serial number: `DR-0001`. No cute name. No personality. Just function.

**What UNLOCKS:** The rig exterior. Shard income. Drone bay (1/12 capacity).

**What the player FEELS:** Intrigue. The aesthetic is cold and industrial — the deep sea is beautiful but hostile. There's an implicit question: "What am I mining for? Why am I down here?"

**TONAL CONTRAST WITH SPIRE:** Where Spire gives you a cute moth and warmth, GRINDSTONE gives you a serial number and pressure readings. Attachment here will be EARNED, not given. The player shouldn't care about DR-0001 yet. They will later.

---

### Minutes 1–3: Production Line

**What the player DOES:**
- Buys DR-0002 (10 Shards). DR-0003 (25 Shards). DR-0004 (50 Shards).
- Drones mine autonomously. Each has slightly different efficiency based on the ore node assigned.
- The rig has labeled bays. Drones slot into them. It feels like managing a factory floor.
- A sonar contact appears at the edge of the screen. Something large. It moves away.

**What UNLOCKS:** Multiple drone bays. Ore node assignment (basic optimization). The sonar — showing that things live out there.

**What the player FEELS:** Efficiency satisfaction. This is a factory game now. The sonar blip is a deliberate Subnautica-style tension seed: the deep is not empty.

---

### Minutes 3–5: Rig Systems

**What the player DOES:**
- Unlocks the Forge: converts Shards into Plates (refined currency for upgrades).
- Upgrades Drill Efficiency (+20% Shard output). Upgrades Hull Plating (rig HP, though the player doesn't know why yet).
- At 5 drones, the rig hums with activity. Production feels good.

**What UNLOCKS:** The Forge. Upgrade tree (Drill, Hull, Sonar, Bay Capacity). Two currencies: Shards (raw) and Plates (refined).

**What the player FEELS:** Builder's satisfaction. "I'm making a machine."

---

### Minutes 5–10: First Contact

**What the player DOES:**
- Sonar alarm. `HOSTILE CONTACT — CLASSIFICATION: SCAVENGER`. A creature — biomechanical, barnacle-crusted — approaches the rig.
- The game explains: "Deploy drones to the defense grid." A 4×3 grid activates around the rig's perimeter.
- Player places drones. **Each drone placed stops mining.** Income drops from ~8/sec to ~3/sec (keeping 2-3 mining).
- Drones repurpose: drills become weapons. They attack the Scavenger. It's slow, with low HP.
- Victory. Drones return to mining. Reward: Salvage (creature parts, used for specialized upgrades).

**What UNLOCKS:** The defense grid (4×3). Salvage economy. The explicit statement: drones are dual-purpose.

**What the player FEELS:** The combat here feels DIFFERENT from Spire. Not cozy — industrial. Drones don't "fight bravely," they mechanically drill into the creature. It's efficient. Clinical. The player feels like an operator, not a guardian.

**No one mourns a drill drone. Yet.**

---

### Minutes 10–15: Specialization Begins

**What the player DOES:**
- Unlocks two new drone types from Salvage:
  - **Cutter** — fast, fragile, high damage. Expensive.
  - **Hauler** — slow, tanky, mines 2x but fights poorly.
- Choices emerge: Do you buy Cutters (combat specialists that earn nothing) or Haulers (great miners that suck at fighting)?
- Buys 2-3 more basic drills. Expands operation.
- Second Scavenger approaches. Player deploys with better positioning.

**What UNLOCKS:** Drone specialization. The strategic tension: economic drones vs. combat drones.

**What the player FEELS:** Strategic engagement. This is a game about optimization. Players who like min-maxing are hooked here.

---

### Minutes 15–20: The Cost of Doing Business

**What the player DOES:**
- A **Stalker** appears — faster, tougher than Scavengers. It targets a specific grid column and rushes it.
- Player must concentrate defense. If drones are spread thin, one dies.
- **First drone death:** DR-0002 is destroyed. The game logs it: `DR-0002 — LOST. Service time: 18 minutes. Total yield: 247 Shards.`
- That's it. No animation. No sentiment. Just a log entry. The bay is empty.

**What UNLOCKS:** The Operations Log (tracks every drone's service record and cause of destruction).

**What the player FEELS:** This is subtle and important. The game DOESN'T tell you to feel sad. It gives you DATA. "18 minutes. 247 Shards." The player supplies the emotion — or doesn't. Some players shrug. Some players stare at that log entry. **The log is doing the emotional work that Spire does with animations.** It's a mirror: it reflects what you bring to it.

---

### Minutes 20–30: Deepening Operations

**What the player DOES:**
- Replaces DR-0002. The new drone is DR-0006 (numbers don't reset — the dead stay dead in the log).
- Unlocks **Overclocking**: any drone can be overclocked for 2x output (mining or combat) but takes damage over time. It WILL die eventually.
- Player experiments with overclocking a basic drill on a rich ore node. Income spikes. The drone's HP ticks down. A countdown to destruction.
- Scavenger wave: 3 simultaneous contacts. Player must deploy most of their workforce. Income flatlines during the fight.

**What UNLOCKS:** Overclocking. Wave attacks. The permanent number gap in the roster (a subtle reminder of loss).

**What the player FEELS:** The factory-manager identity deepens. But Overclocking introduces a new emotional texture: intentional sacrifice. You CHOOSE to burn out a drone for profit. It's not combat loss — it's exploitation. **This is where GRINDSTONE starts asking uncomfortable questions about how the player treats their "workers."**

**⚠️ HONESTY CHECK — The attachment problem:** GRINDSTONE has a harder job than Spire. Drills aren't cute. Serial numbers aren't names. If the player doesn't care about drones by minute 30, the sacrifice mechanic is just math. **Fix:** The Operations Log needs to be COMPELLING. Show: total shards mined, enemies killed, times deployed, times survived. Make each drone's page a resume. When DR-0001 has survived 5 fights and mined 1,200 shards, the player WILL notice when it dies. Data creates attachment for a certain kind of player.

---

### Minutes 30–45: The First Leviathan

**What the player DOES:**
- Sonar goes haywire. `CLASSIFICATION: LEVIATHAN — DESIGNATION: "THE MAW"`. The screen shakes. Something enormous approaches.
- The Maw is a multi-tile boss. It occupies 2 columns of the 4×3 grid. Its body has segments with independent HP.
- Player must deploy 8-10 drones. Income drops to near-zero. The Maw attacks in patterns: bite (front row), thrash (random tiles), and SWALLOW (removes a drone from the grid entirely — destroyed, no recovery).
- **The Maw swallows DR-0001.** The original drone. Service time: 33 minutes. Total yield: 412 Shards. 6 combats survived.
- The fight is HARD. Player likely wins but loses 3-4 drones total. The Maw drops a Core — a rare component for a major upgrade.

**What UNLOCKS:** Leviathan-class encounters. Cores (prestige-adjacent currency). The Depth Gauge — shows how deep the rig can descend. Cores power descent.

**What the player FEELS:**
- During the fight: Tension. The 4×3 grid with a 2-column boss is CLAUSTROPHOBIC. There's nowhere to hide.
- When DR-0001 is swallowed: **This is GRINDSTONE's gut-punch equivalent to Spire's bonded Echo death.** The first drone. The one that's been there since boot-up. It was just a box with a drill, but the log entry tells its whole story. Players who checked the log will feel it. Players who didn't will learn to start checking.
- After the fight: Pyrrhic victory. You won but you're broke and short-staffed.

---

### Minutes 45–60: Rebuilding the Machine

**What the player DOES:**
- Rebuilds drone fleet. Invests Core into first depth descent: the rig goes deeper. New ore nodes with higher yield.
- Unlocks **Retrofit**: surviving drones can be upgraded with salvage. A retrofitted drone has a mark after its number: `DR-0003-R1`. Marks stack with subsequent retrofits.
- The retrofit system gives veterans tangible superiority over fresh drones.
- Encounters scale: Stalkers come in pairs, a new type appears (Angler — lures drones out of position with a false sonar ping).

**What UNLOCKS:** Depth descent. Retrofit system. Angler enemy type (positional disruption).

**What the player FEELS:** Recovery. Purpose. The retrofit system is GRINDSTONE's answer to Spire's bond stars — it marks veterans explicitly. DR-0003-R1 is now meaningfully better than a fresh drone, and the player knows it.

---

### Minutes 60–90: Descent & The Pressure Builds

**What the player DOES:**
- Second depth descent. Ore is richer but creatures are more aggressive. Attacks come every 3-4 minutes instead of 5-6.
- Unlocks **Autonomous Protocols**: drones can be set to auto-deploy in preset formations. The player designs defense templates and the rig executes them. This is the idle transition — combat becomes partially automated.
- **Minute 75: Leviathan #2 — "THE DRILL."** An armored worm that burrows through the grid, destroying tiles temporarily. The 4×3 grid shrinks to 3×2 mid-fight. Drones crammed together take collateral damage.
- **This is designed to wipe unprepared players.** If your drones aren't retrofitted, you lose everything.
- **Expected outcome: 50% chance of total wipe.**

**What UNLOCKS:** Autonomous Protocols (auto-combat). Grid destruction mechanic. Potentially: the Refit system (see below).

**What the player FEELS:**
- If they survive: "I'm a god damn engineer." Pure mechanical mastery satisfaction.
- If they wipe: The rig goes dark. All drones lost. The Operations Log is a graveyard. But the sonar pings. The rig reboots. `GRINDSTONE PLATFORM — REINITIALIZING.` **The Refit:** all Cores and depth progress are kept. Drone production is faster at known depths. But you start from DR-0001 again. The log remembers the dead.

---

### Minutes 90–120: The Refit Loop

**What the player DOES:**
- Whether they wiped or survived, the player is now in the refit/prestige loop.
- **If wiped:** Rebuilding is faster. New drones start with baseline retrofits from researched tech. DR-0001 Mark II mines at 3x the original's rate. The early game compresses.
- **If survived:** Third descent. New biome: hydrothermal vents. Extreme heat damages unshielded drones passively. Must unlock Thermal Plating.
- Either path: by minute 110, the player faces a choice — descend further (harder, richer) or consolidate (max out current depth's resources).
- **Minute 115: A sonar contact. Massive. Deeper than the rig has ever gone. CLASSIFICATION: UNKNOWN. It's not coming toward you. It's below you. Waiting.**

**What UNLOCKS:** Refit system fully. Thermal biome (if surviving). The Deep Contact — the long-game mystery. What's at the bottom?

**What the player FEELS:** Drive. GRINDSTONE's hook isn't warmth — it's the question "how deep can I go?" The unknown contact is a perfect curiosity hook. The refit loop makes every wipe feel like a new expedition, not a punishment.

---

## Hours 2–10: Broader Strokes

### Hour 2–5: The Industrial Machine

**Loop evolution:**
- Refits every 20-30 minutes. Each one pushes 1-2 depths deeper.
- **Hour 2 unlock: Drone AI Personalities.** At Retrofit level 3+, drones develop behavioral quirks logged in their file. DR-0003-R3 "tends to overshoot targets." DR-0007-R2 "returns to bay 0.3s faster than average." These are FLAVOR — no mechanical impact — but they humanize the machines. The Operations Log becomes a character sheet.
- **Hour 3 unlock: The Foundry.** Build specialized mega-drones from salvage. These are grid-dominating units but cost a fortune to build and replace. First one: the Goliath (2x2 on the 4×3 grid, massive HP and damage, generates 0 income).
- **Hour 4 unlock: Rival Rigs.** Sonar detects other mining operations. Competitive element: race to depth milestones for bonus resources. (Async PvE — compare progress with other players, no direct conflict.)
- **Hour 5 unlock: The Abyss.** Below depth 20, the biome changes entirely. No more ore — only Cores from creatures. The economy inverts: income comes from combat, not mining. Drones become pure fighters. The factory game becomes a war game.

**What prevents boredom:**
- Drone AI Personalities (hour 2) transforms the attachment model. Players start NAMING their drones in their heads.
- The Foundry (hour 3) adds a build-a-mech layer.
- Rival Rigs (hour 4) adds social comparison.
- The Abyss (hour 5) literally inverts the core loop. Nothing prevents boredom like making the player relearn the game.

**Idle vs. Active:**
- **Idle:** Autonomous Protocols handle routine attacks. Drones mine. Good for 2-6 hour idle windows — return to banked Shards and an Operations Log of auto-resolved combats (with possible drone losses, which makes checking the log feel like reading a newspaper).
- **Active:** Leviathans require manual control. Depth descents. Foundry builds. Retrofit decisions. ~10-15 min active per session.

### Hour 5–10: Into the Abyss

- **Hour 6: Leviathan Hunts.** The player can now proactively hunt Leviathans instead of waiting for attacks. Deploy an expedition — choose your grid, choose your drones, venture into the dark. Risk/reward: if you lose, those drones are gone and your rig is undefended.
- **Hour 7: Drone Legacies.** When a drone with 5+ retrofits is destroyed, it leaves behind a Blueprint — a template for a superior replacement. Like Echo Memories but framed as engineering iteration. DR-0003's Blueprint produces drones that start at R2 with its quirks.
- **Hour 8: The Signal.** The unknown deep contact emits a signal. Decoding it (a multi-prestige quest) reveals coordinates. Something built the creatures. The Leviathans are guardians. You're digging toward something that was buried on purpose.
- **Hour 9-10: First Contact.** Reach the coordinates. A structure. Not natural. Not human. The first Leviathan that attacks here is different — it's trying to communicate. The game asks: do you drill through, or do you listen?

**⚠️ HONESTY CHECK — Hours 7-9 content drought risk:** The Abyss inversion (hour 5) buys 2-3 hours of freshness. By hour 8, pure combat can feel repetitive. **Fixes:**
1. The Signal is a narrative throughline that gives purpose to grinding.
2. Leviathan Hunts are opt-in and high-stakes — each one feels like a raid.
3. Blueprints reframe loss as progress (same function as Memories in Spire).
4. The moral choice at hour 10 is a genuine surprise in a genre that rarely offers narrative agency.

**Key difference from Spire:** GRINDSTONE's emotional curve is FLATTER in the early game (no immediate warmth) but STEEPER at peaks (the gut punches hit harder because you didn't expect to care). The Maw eating DR-0001 is devastating BECAUSE the game never told you to love it.

**Valleys to watch:**
- Minutes 25-30: Overclock experimentation is engaging but can feel like spreadsheet time. Fix with the wave attack (forces action).
- Minutes 55-60: Post-Maw rebuilding. Fix with retrofit unlocking (immediate new toy).
- Hours 7-9: Abyss combat grind. Fix with The Signal narrative and Leviathan Hunts.

**"One more run" moments:**
1. **Minute 35** (DR-0001 dies): "I need to be more efficient."
2. **Minute 90** (refit): "Let me see how fast I can get back."
3. **Hour 5** (Abyss inversion): "Wait, everything changed?"
4. **Hour 8** (The Signal): "I NEED to know what's down there."

**Attachment peak:** Hour 2-4, when Drone AI Personalities activate. Players will screenshot their Operations Logs. They'll share their oldest surviving drone's stats on Reddit. The attachment is EMERGENT, not designed — which makes it stickier.

# COMPARATIVE NOTES

| Aspect | Spire of Echoes | GRINDSTONE |
|---|---|---|
| **Attachment method** | Immediate (cute, named, animated) | Emergent (data, service records, AI quirks) |
| **Sacrifice feeling** | "I'm sorry, little one" | "Acceptable losses... wait, not that one" |
| **Grid tension** | 4×4 = room to maneuver, positioning matters | 4×3 = cramped, claustrophobic, every tile precious |
| **Prestige framing** | "Their light lives on" (spiritual) | "Refit and redeploy" (industrial) |
| **Player identity** | Guardian/caretaker | Operator/engineer |
| **Boredom risk** | Idle lulls between storms | Combat repetition in Abyss |
| **Biggest emotional moment** | Bonded Echo's death animation (min 35) | DR-0001's log entry after The Maw (min 35) |
| **Long-term hook** | What are Echoes? Why do they come? | What's at the bottom? Who built it? |
| **Target player** | Wants to feel, then optimize | Wants to optimize, then accidentally feels |

Both games hit the same emotional beats at roughly the same times — but through completely different mechanisms. Spire TELLS you to care, then rewards caring. GRINDSTONE dares you not to care, then makes you realize you already did.
