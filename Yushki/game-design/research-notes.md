# Research Notes — Incremental + Roguelike Hybrid

## Reference Games

### Tower Wizard (Primary Incremental Reference)
- Click orb → gather magic → summon spirits → upgrade tower → prestige
- Active + idle hybrid, charming pixel art (Godot engine)
- **Weakness noted by community:** Prestige feels mandatory too early. Good incrementals should feel satisfying *before* prestige, with prestige as a bonus layer.
- Multiple resource types: magic, spirits, knowledge, buildings
- Definite ending (not infinite)

### Balatro (Primary Sacrifice/Tension Reference)
- Poker hands as combat, jokers modify scoring exponentially
- **Core insight:** Every hand/discard feels critical from round one. Playing cards = losing them.
- Perfect information — you always know what you're working with, so every decision feels fair
- "Provide as many ways of breaking the game as possible" (Ed McMillen philosophy) — the chance of getting THE combo is low enough that it feels earned
- Antes escalate → forces you to constantly build, not coast
- Shop between rounds creates resource tension (money vs. card improvement)

### Into the Breach (Grid Tactics Reference)
- Perfect information puzzles on small grids
- Position/displacement > raw damage
- Protecting buildings = shared health pool (you lose grid power, not individual units)
- **Key lesson:** Grid size matters. Small grid = every cell counts.

### Idle Grid (Direct Competitor)
- Incremental + grid placement, released Jan 2025 on Steam
- "Adjacent bonuses and tile synergy" — exists in market but niche
- Important to differentiate from this

### Other Incrementals
- **NGU Idle / Antimatter Dimensions:** Deep prestige layers, multiple interlocking systems, appeal to optimizers
- **Melvor Idle:** RuneScape-like skill training, ultra-long-form, very chill
- **Idle Slayer:** Minion prestige, active runner elements mixed with idle
- **Cell to Singularity:** Grand narrative arc (evolution) makes numbers meaningful

### Slice & Dice (Roguelike Tactics Reference)
- 128 hero classes as dice with unique faces
- Simple rules, absurd variety
- Every run feels genuinely different because hero combinations create emergent strategies

## Key Design Lessons
1. **Prestige should feel like a reward, not a requirement** (Tower Wizard criticism)
2. **Sacrifice tension only works if what you're losing has ongoing value** (Balatro)
3. **Small grids force meaningful decisions** (Into the Breach)
4. **Perfect information makes sacrifice feel fair, not punishing** (Balatro + ItB)
5. **Emergent variety from simple systems > designed variety from complex ones** (Slice & Dice)
6. **Narrative framing makes numbers feel meaningful** (Cell to Singularity)
