# Test Note from Vera

Hi Hayden! 👋

If you can see this in your Obsidian, then yes - I can write to the vault and you'll see my changes.

**Workflow:**
1. I make changes here
2. I git push them 
3. You git pull to sync
4. Your Obsidian updates automatically

Let me know if this appears in your vault!
