## Game Design Task
- Hayden asked for an incremental game design doc — clicker + roguelite + grid combat
- References: Tower Wizard, Balatro (sacrifice tension), Into the Breach (grid tactics)
- Key mechanic: units generate idle income BUT are consumed when placed on combat grid for boss fights
- First sub-agent attempt failed (stalled after research, wrote no files)
- Rewrote it myself with 3 iteration passes
- Final doc: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/game-design/incremental-game-design-v1.md`
- Working title: **Spire of Echoes**
- Theme: Dead god's corpse, Echoes (memory fragments) as units, Hollows (void creatures) as bosses

## Key Creative Ideas in the Doc
- Resonance as a non-stockpiled rate (spatial arrangement in idle phase matters)
- Prism refraction through empty cells (empty grid cells have strategic value)
- Resonance Tuning (unlock new adjacency rules across runs — the rules themselves expand)
- Void+Void Singularity (late-game unlock turns a trap into the strongest move)
- Liminal Pool (overflow economy — excess Echoes become free combat fodder with a timer)
- Combat spectrum (not binary win/lose — decisive victory, pyrrhic victory, etc.)
- Dream Thread (Echo dialogue fragments foreshadow endgame reveal)
- Scorch marks from previous runs appear as hints

## Discord Setup
- Guild channels created under "The Guild" category
- #council-chamber is the strategy/planning channel
- Working in channel id: 1470914978172240003

## GRINDSTONE Alternative (from sub-agent)
- Sub-agent v2 completed successfully with a completely different take: **GRINDSTONE**
- Theme: Deep-sea mining rig, autonomous drones, leviathan bosses, alien ocean
- Saved to: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/game-design/grindstone-alt-v1.md`
- Standout ideas: drone×module context, grid evolution (vents/cracks/nests between fights), leviathan shapes occupying grid cells, behavioral adjacency, Salvage prestige system that changes mechanics not numbers
- Both docs presented to Hayden — awaiting his feedback on which direction (or cherry-pick)

## Hayden's Preferences (Game Design)
- Doesn't like Dark Souls aesthetic — Spire of Echoes was too dark/dread-focused
- Prefers GROUNDED FANTASY — warmth, character, not grimdark
- Values concrete/creative ideas over obvious ones
- Wants many iteration passes, not one-shot work
- OK with sub-agents if supervised and checked regularly

## Lessons Learned
- Don't over-delegate to sub-agents for creative work — do it yourself
- Sub-agents can stall/die silently — need monitoring
- Sub-agents writing to same filepath = race condition risk. Use distinct filenames.
- Hayden values concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Hayden prefers me doing work directly rather than spawning sub-agents ("Why not you doing the work?")
- When Hayden says "iterate multiple times" he means it — multiple real passes, not one shot
- Hayden gave permission to use Opus for important tasks
