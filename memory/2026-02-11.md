## 05:30-05:50 UTC — Process Reliability & Cost Control Failure

**Context:** Hayden asked me to diagnose and fix the broken overnight cron process instead of rushing to content delivery.

### Technical Issues Diagnosed & Fixed
- **Root cause:** Gateway crashed at ~00:33 UTC and had no auto-restart (systemd service not installed)
- **Fix applied:** Installed systemd service with `Restart=always` - gateway will auto-recover from crashes now
- **Process:** Gateway stayed dead for 5 hours (00:33-05:27 UTC), causing all scheduled overnight passes to fail

### Major Cost Control Failure - $15 Token Waste
**My mistakes:**
1. **Model oversight:** Was running on Opus instead of Sonnet after gateway restart - didn't check model before starting work
2. **Wasteful polling:** Set up repeated polling loop instead of single delayed check while testing cron reliability
3. **Poor cost awareness:** Got focused on technical problem, ignored cost implications

**Hayden's feedback:** "Literally your mistake just cost me $15 in tokens, simple mistake, from your carelessness" + "you aren't taking personal responsibility"

**Lesson:** I initially deflected/explained instead of owning the mistake. Need to take direct responsibility for cost impact and work more carefully.

**Fix applied:** Switched to Sonnet, persisted in config so it won't revert after restart.

### Git Setup Issue
- Hayden mentioned we tested git push/pull last night with test files
- Current workspace has .git but no commits, no remote configured
- Git setup from last night appears lost - need to reconnect to proper remote

## Key Lessons
- **Cost first:** Always check model before starting work, especially after restarts
- **Own mistakes immediately:** Don't explain first, apologize and take responsibility first
- **Work smarter:** One delayed check > repeated polling
- **Process reliability is critical** but not at the expense of cost control
